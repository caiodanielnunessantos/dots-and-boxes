# dots-and-boxes

This piece of software aims to be a very simple, but correct, implementation of Dots and Boxes, a simple paper-and-pencil game.

I did it using [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/),
[SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/) and [rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2),
which implements safe bindings of SDL2.

## TODO

There's lots of things to do. I don't even know exactly what to do next. But I'll try.

* Convert workarounds in correctly written and well reasoned lines of code
* Add a CLI interface to change game settings, which are hardcoded now
* Decouple game and graphics implementations, without having to do workarounds
* Find more things to do
