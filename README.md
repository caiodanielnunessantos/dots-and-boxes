# dots-and-boxes

## THIS IS AN ABANDONED PROJECT

Hi, everyone, I am the writer of this crate. I would like to say that I am
going to transfer the ownership of the name "dots-and-boxes" to any person
who is able and willing to take care of it better than I am able to.

I am not a programmer and this project was done in just one day in my teenage
years. I was just excited to find out why Rust is so much loved and decided to
try to create something simple using it. Now I understand it and I
really love it too. Big thanks to everyone who contributed to it.

The name "dots-and-boxes" is very simple and generic and I think a much better
project deserves it. So much better that I am not the right person to create
it. I am sure that a real programmer could do something much better than I am
capable of in a short amount of time. So I am transferring the ownership of it.

Big thanks to [GitHub](https://github.com) for hosting this project and big
thanks to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) for making it easily available to everyone
using cargo-cli and
[`cargo-install`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html)
command.
